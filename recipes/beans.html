        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Roasted green beans are a great alternative to fast-food French fries, and they're better for you too! This 4-ingredient side dish of crisp-tender caramelized green beans is so easy, you can dish it up after just 15 minutes in the oven and serve it for fancy dinners or weeknight suppers. My family and friends love these as a snack or hors d'oeuvre. No matter how many I make, it's never enough!
