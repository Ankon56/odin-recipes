        <p>
            Churros (Mexican fritters) are very common at fairs. In my border hometown, the line at this stand is always overwhelming. People wait hours in line just to get a taste of these churros. I have run across several recipes but this is the best one by far.
        </p>
        <p>
            These churros are crispy on the outside, yet wonderfully tender on the inside. This restaurant-worthy churro recipe will quickly become a staple in your dessert rotation.
